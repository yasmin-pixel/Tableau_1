 ##   Airbnb Data Analysis: Maximising Client Revenue üè†üí∞

##   Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on providing insights for profitable Airbnb property investments. The analysis leverages Airbnb data from Kaggle to explore key trends in pricing, revenue, and discounts, ultimately aiming to advise a client on maximizing their returns. 

This project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating skills in data analysis, visualization, and insight generation.

##   Key Analysis Areas

The analysis focuses on several key areas to guide investment decisions:

* **Best Time to List Properties:** Identifies optimal listing times for maximum revenue. 
* **Price Analysis by Zip Code:** Determines high-value areas by analyzing average listing prices across different zip codes. 
* **Revenue Patterns:** Examines revenue trends over time to identify seasonality and predict earning potential.
* **Average Price vs. Number of Bedrooms:** Analyzes the relationship between the number of bedrooms and listing prices to identify profitable property configurations. 
* **Discount Analysis:** Evaluates the impact of discounts on occupancy and revenue for listings with varying bedroom counts. 

##   Methodology & Tools

The analysis was conducted using Python. Key steps included:

* Data Loading & Cleaning:  Importing and preparing the Airbnb dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  Analyzing key trends in pricing, revenue, and discounts.
* Visualization:  Creating charts and graphs to effectively communicate findings.
* Dashboard Creation: Developing an interactive dashboard to compare property listing performance. 


##   Key Findings & Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights for optimizing Airbnb property investments:

* **Optimal Listing Times:** Identification of the best times to list properties to maximise returns. 
* **High-Value Locations:** Identification of zip codes with the highest average listing prices, indicating areas with strong revenue potential. 
* **Revenue Seasonality:** Revenue patterns show peak seasons (e.g., summer and December) that property owners should capitalize on. 
* **Bedroom Count Impact:** Analysis of how the number of bedrooms influences pricing and revenue. 
* **Discount Strategies:** Listings with fewer bedrooms tend to offer lower discounts, while those with more bedrooms offer higher discounts to attract bookings.

##   Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created to visualise and compare performance metrics such as discounts, occupancy rates, and revenue across different bedroom configurations.  This tool enables data-driven decision-making for pricing strategies.
